	This map shows the locations of huts and camping sites that I stayed at on a recent tramping trip to Rakiura. On this trip, I spent 11 days walking the North-West and Southern Circuits, as well as running the entire Rakiura Great Walk in a single day. I did the circuit in an anti-clockwise direction, starting at Oban and finishing at Fred's Camp Hut where I got a water taxi back to Oban. The trip initially only was meant to encompass the North-West Circuit, however, due to the kindness of other trampers providing us with additional food, we were able to extend the trip to include the southern circuit. We saw two kiwi, marked in red markers, and heard of many other sightings from other trampers along the journey. The polygon highlights the extent of Rakiura National Park, which is my favourite National Park to visit.
