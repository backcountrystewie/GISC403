	This map illustrates the tramping tracks and huts visited on a recent journey to Rakiura Stewart Island. Over 11 days, my partner and I explored both the North-West and Southern Circuits, following an anti-clockwise route from Oban to Fred's Camp Hut, where we returned to Oban via water taxi. Notable encounters, including two kiwi sightings, are marked in red, highlighting their rarity. The polygon delineates the expanse of Rakiura National Park, a cherished destination for hardy trampers. To improve visibility, the water surrounding the island has been deepened in color, emphasizing the lush greenery of the island itself. Huts and track lines are depicted in green, mirroring the colors of the Department of Conservation, who manage the track and hut system. To accurately represent the island's topography, track lines were added to Mapbox as shapefiles due to limitations with displaying existing OSM track lines at lower zoom ratios. Despite the challenges faced in mastering Mapbox without prior experience, efforts were made to accurately portray the terrain. Contour lines, highlighted in orange, offer visual cues of the diverse landscape encountered throughout the journey.
